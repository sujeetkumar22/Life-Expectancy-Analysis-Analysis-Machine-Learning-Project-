# Life-Expectancy-Analysis-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Project

Life expectancy is a critical indicator of a nation's health and socio-economic development. Various factors such as immunization, mortality rate, GDP, alcohol consumption, and healthcare expenditure impact life expectancy. This project aims to analyze life expectancy across 193 countries over the years 2000 to 2015, using data collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN).
The objective is to explore how socio-economic and health-related variables affect life expectancy and build predictive models using machine learning techniques to estimate life expectancy based on these factors.
